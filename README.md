# object_detection
This project was made as a final submission for Proglint 6 month internship. I have used yolo v11 and freiburg groceries dataset.
you can find the annotated dataset in the following link "https://1drv.ms/f/c/7671e300fff5b702/EpU6_YUFepRDmW9Fva3EHAQB5hLSOcbxKVTq9_JPp_dJaw?e=YJJxVw"
The dataset is small since i was running only on cpu based training on my laptop.
Hope this helps :)
